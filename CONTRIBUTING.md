# Contributing to TechnoBot
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Comment your code and commit your changes.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, **test it!** For help running the bot on your computer, see [the instructions here](#instructions-for-building-and-running-technobot-on-your-computer).
4. Issue the pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/TechnoVisionDev/TechnoBot/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/TechnoVisionDev/TechnoBot/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a well-written bug report. A bug report for TechnoBot will not look exactly the same, but the important parts in the example are the expected behavior and the actual behavior explained completely and concisely so anyone can reproduce the issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can. (This may not apply to TechnoBot because it is not an API)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
